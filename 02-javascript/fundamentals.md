## Comments

Comments are non-excuted code. Appropriate uses of comments include:

* Explanations for particularly tricky parts of code
* Definitions of functions or classes
* To temporarily disable one or more lines of code

> Tip: The most common inappropriate use of comments is to "save" old code. Remember this is what Git is for!
