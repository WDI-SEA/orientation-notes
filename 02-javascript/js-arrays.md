# Arrays and Objects

We've learned a little bit about primitive types, now let's dig into complex types. We'll start with [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

## Complex Types: Arrays

You can store your name in a variable as a string:

```js
let name = 'Brandi'
```

But what if you need the names of a whole class? We need a _collection_ of strings rather than just a single string. We can use an array. An array is a data structure, which basically means you can store multiple items in it. You can recognize an array by the square brackets `[]`.

```js
let emptyArray = []
let classNames = ['Brandi', 'Nick', 'Yashoma', 'Sean', 'Anna', 'Sarah']
```

## Complex Types: Objects

Note: We will do this if we have time.

## Built-in Array Methods

Let's go through some examples like `sort`, `reverse`, and `indexOf`.
