We don't want to get too deep into JavaScript language details, but while we have a moment, let's review some of the topics from the pre-work. This will be our slow ramp up into the quick pace of the course!

This section will cover:

* JavaScript Array and Object types
* JavaScript conditionals and boolean expressions

Coming soon:

* JavaScript loops
