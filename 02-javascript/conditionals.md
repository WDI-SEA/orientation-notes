# JavaScript Conditionals

JavaScript conditionals (if statements) are one way that we alter the control flow of our code. Sometimes we only want code to execute if a certain condition is met. For example, I want my smart thermostat to turn up the heat _only if I am cold_! Let's talk about control flow in a general sense for a second.

## Control Flow

Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Javascript executes top-to-bottom, _unless we alter the control flow_.

**Why/how would we alter the control flow?**

1. Skip lines of code based on a condition.
1. Repeat lines of code when traversing a data set or just for the sake of DRY code.

**Here are some statements we can use to alter the control flow:**

1. [if](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
1. [switch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)
1. [while](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)
1. [for](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)
1. [for...in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)

But before that, let's create the expressions needed for these statements

## Truthiness

If you recall, back in the JS fundamentals lesson, we mentioned the idea of "truthiness" and "falsiness".
