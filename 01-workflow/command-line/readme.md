## Some Tips

**Tab Completion*

Do you enjoy typing? Yeah neither do we. You can do a whole lot less of it on the terminal if you use tab completion. If you're typing a file name and let's say it's a really long name then you can type the first couple letters and press `TAB`. If there are no other matching filenames, voila, it's automatically filled in for you! If there is more than one match, you'll see them all and be able to tab through them!

**History**

So your computer remembers the commands you've used previously... we can use this to our advantage because as you'll notice throughout the course, you'll be using the same commands a lot! By using the up and down arrows, you can go back through your previous commands.

Additionally, this becomes more useful because you can essentially filter your past commands by typing a part of it. For example, say you'd like to look at old `git` commands you've used. If you type the word `git` first and then proceed to use the up arrow you will be going through only your past commands that started with the word `git`. Neat huh?
