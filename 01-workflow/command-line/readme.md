# Terminal Tips and Tricks

## How do I even open this thing? I'm scared.

On a Mac, you may be accustomed to opening up your `Applications` folder and hunting around for the program that you need. There are a couple even quicker ways you can open programs (including your terminal program). 

#### 1. Swipe all fingers from the outside of your trackpad to the inside

It's a little hard to describe, but it looks like a grasping motion. Imagine that there is a marble in the middle of your trackpad that you're trying to grab. This will bring up a screen with all of your applications. Simply click on the one that you want.

#### 2. The `âŒ˜` + `SPACEBAR` keyboard shortcut

This brings up a textbox that you can start typing the name of the program you're looking for. Try this out now. 

* Press and hold the command key followed by the spacebar
* Start typing the word `terminal`. You probably only need two or three letters for it to narrow it down to the program you want.
* Once the terminal program pops up, select it

There we go! You're in the terminal now!

## Some Tips

**Tab Completion*

Do you enjoy typing? Yeah neither do we. You can do a whole lot less of it on the terminal if you use tab completion. If you're typing a file name and let's say it's a really long name then you can type the first couple letters and press `TAB`. If there are no other matching filenames, voila, it's automatically filled in for you! If there is more than one match, you'll see them all and be able to tab through them!

**History**

So your computer remembers the commands you've used previously... we can use this to our advantage because as you'll notice throughout the course, you'll be using the same commands a lot! By using the up and down arrows, you can go back through your previous commands.

Additionally, this becomes more useful because you can essentially filter your past commands by typing a part of it. For example, say you'd like to look at old `git` commands you've used. If you type the word `git` first and then proceed to use the up arrow you will be going through only your past commands that started with the word `git`. Neat huh?
