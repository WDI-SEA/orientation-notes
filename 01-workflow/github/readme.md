## Who invented git?

Linus Torvalds - of Linux fame - invented git in 2005. You can read more about that [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git) but the short version is that he invented it as a version control system for the community that was developing for the Linux operating system after the tool they used previously broke down.

## Git vs Github

Remember, *git* and *github* are two different things! Git is a version control system for managing your source code. Github is a platform to host your code online so others can access it and collaborate with you on it. You can think of Github as social media for Git!
