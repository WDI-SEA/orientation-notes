## Version control - what is it and why would we want to use it?

Perhaps you've had a class in school with a final project or essay. As you go through numerous drafts, and try out different strategies, you want to be free to try new things without the fear of losing your old writing just in case you need to go back or rework back in some stuff at a later time. Maybe your desktop looked like this:

**My-Essay.doc**
**My-Essay2.doc**
**My-Essay-New.doc**
**My-Essay-New2.doc**
**My-Essay-final.doc**
**My-Essay-final-version.doc**
**My-Essay-actual-final.doc**
**My-Essay-REAL-FINAL-VERSION.doc**

Don't tell us you can't relate! But wouldn't it be nice if we just had a program to handle any history or previous versions for us so we didn't have to keep a dozen copies of the same file? This is where version control systems come in. 

> The version control system we use is called `git` - it's the most popular version control system right now

## Who invented git?

Linus Torvalds - of Linux fame - invented git in 2005. You can read more about that [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git) but the short version is that he invented it as a version control system for the community that was developing for the Linux operating system after the tool they used previously broke down.

> It may take awhile to truly believe this - but git was made to be simple and elegant (compared to other version control systems)!

## Git vs Github

Remember, *git* and *github* are two different things! Git is a version control system for managing your source code. Github is a platform to host your code online so others can access it and collaborate with you on it. You can think of Github as social media for Git!

## What git commands do I need to know about?

Let's cover a few basic things that Git and Github can do that are useful to know about.

### Forking

What is a fork? When you visit a repository on Github, you'll see a button called "Fork" in the top right corner. It looks like this:

Forking is something you'll need to be logged in to Github to do. When you fork someone else's repository, a complete copy of that repository is made on your own account. This may feel a little weird at first, but in fact, openness, sharing, and cooperation is highly respected within the software development community.

## Activity Time!

Let's practice using Github together! Visit the [Pull Test Repo](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/pull_test) on GA Seattle's Github account. Your instructor will lead you through forking, cloning, pushing, and pull requests.
