# Acquire Your Tools

## Getting on Slack

Likely you've already gotten an email about signing up for our student Slack group - [ga-students.slack.com](ga-students.slack.com). If you haven't already signed up, please take a second to do so now.

Once you've signed up and logged into the Slack app, let's make sure you're in the right channels. Here are some you should definitely be a part of:

* sei-sea-30
* seattle
* sea-frontdesk

> Tip: We'll be communicating on Slack a LOT. It's going to be our main source of communication! Get the desktop and phone apps so you don't miss out!

## Choosing a Text Editor

You'll develop your own opinions on this - every software developer does! However, let's start out with a couple baseline rules.

#### 1. Pick at least one of the following three options for your default text editor

**VS Code**: Short for "Visual Studio Code". This one is probably the most popular among students. There are many plug-ins, the ability to do live code-shares, and git integration. If you don't otherwise have an opinion or know which one to go with, just pick this one.

**Sublime Text**: This one is the second most popular among students and offers many of the same features as VS Code, however the free version has an annoying pop-up that comes up every so many saves.

**ATOM**: This one is nice too, and again offers a lot of the same types of plug-ins as the other two.

You are welcome to adopt more than one of these, or even all three. Your instructor likely has all three editors installed.

#### 2. Refrain from using a command-line text editor such as vim or nano as an editor

I hope this is self-explanatory but there's no reason to use these tools as a beginner as they are intimidating and a little hard to use, and there's honestly no need in this class to show off. We're all here to learn. In other words, don't be this guy:

### Helpful Settings and Plug-ins for Text Editors

#### 1. Auto-Save (setting)

You're beating your head against the wall. You just can't find your error and you have no explanation why the computer is acting the way it is. After someone else takes a look it becomes apparent *you just didn't save the file*!! So frustrating! Say goodbye to this problem for good by enabling your text editor to do you a solid and set the auto-save feature on.

**VS Code**

The easiest way to turn on auto-save in VS Code is simply to go up to File -> Auto-Save (see screenshot below).

There are additional auto-save settings you can configure listed on [VS Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save), but simply turning on auto-save will do the trick for most of us.

**Sublime Text**

To turn on auto-save in Sublime Text:

1. Go up to the bar at the top and click "Sublime Text"
1. Hover over "Preferences"
1. Under the menu that comes up from the previous step, click "Settings"
1. Change the setting "save_on_focus_lost" from false to true

#### 2. Color highlighter

Optional but cool. This will highlight the CSS color whenever you use a hex-code or named color in your CSS files.

**Directions for Sublime Text**

1. Open Sublime Text
1. Press `⇧⌘P` (SHIFT + COMMAND + The letter P)
1. For Sublime Text, type "Install Package"
1. Select the option "Package Control: Install Package"

Last, start typing "[Color Highlighter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Color%20Highlighter)". This is the package you want for Sublime Text.

**Directions for VS Code**

1. Open up VS Code

#### 3. Pick your favorite text editor and dig in
