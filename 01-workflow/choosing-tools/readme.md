# Acquire Your Tools

## Getting on Slack

Likely you've already gotten an email about signing up for our student Slack group - [ga-students.slack.com](ga-students.slack.com). If you haven't already signed up, please take a second to do so now.

Once you've signed up and logged into the Slack app, let's make sure you're in the right channels. Here are some you should definitely be a part of:

* sei-sea-30
* seattle
* sea-frontdesk

> Tip: We'll be communicating on Slack a LOT. It's going to be our main source of communication! Get the desktop and phone apps so you don't miss out!

## Choosing a Text Editor

You'll develop your own opinions on this - every software developer does! However, let's start out with a couple baseline rules.

#### 1. Pick at least one of the following three options for your default text editor

**VS Code**: Short for "Visual Studio Code". This one is probably the most popular among students. There are many plug-ins, the ability to do live code-shares, and git integration. If you don't otherwise have an opinion or know which one to go with, just pick this one.

**Sublime Text**: This one is the second most popular among students and offers many of the same features as VS Code, however the free version has an annoying pop-up that comes up every so many saves.

**ATOM**: This one is nice too, and again offers a lot of the same types of plug-ins as the other two.

You are welcome to adopt more than one of these, or even all three. Your instructor likely has all three editors installed.

#### 2. Refrain from using a command-line text editor such as vim or nano as an editor

I hope this is self-explanatory but there's no reason to use these tools as a beginner as they are intimidating and a little hard to use, and there's honestly no need in this class to show off. We're all here to learn.

## Downloading Helpful Tools

The following tools aren't strictly necessary, but they are user interfaces to view your data in a really nice, straight-forward way. We use and recommend the following if you don't already have your own alternatives in place:

* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) allows you to test your APIs. It's a lightweight alternative to Postman. Works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.
