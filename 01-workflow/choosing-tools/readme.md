# Acquire Your Tools

## Getting on Slack

Likely you've already gotten an email about signing up for our student Slack group - [ga-students.slack.com](ga-students.slack.com). If you haven't already signed up, please take a second to do so now.

Once you've signed up and logged into the Slack app, let's make sure you're in the right channels. Here are some you should definitely be a part of:

* sei-sea-30
* seattle
* sea-frontdesk

> Tip: We'll be communicating on Slack a LOT. It's going to be our main source of communication! Get the desktop and phone apps so you don't miss out!

## Bookmark Important Links

Bookmark your class calendar for [SEI 30](https://sei30.herokuapp.com) so that you have access to your schedule outline.

## Downloading Helpful Tools

The following tools aren't strictly necessary, but they are user interfaces to view your data in a really nice, straight-forward way. We use and recommend the following if you don't already have your own alternatives in place:

* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) allows you to test your APIs. It's a lightweight alternative to Postman. Works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.
* [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) is a GUI that allows you to access a PostgreSQL database. Only for Mac. Use PGAdmin for Linux/Windows alternative.
* [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) is a GUI that allows you to access a Mongo database (formerly known as robomongo). Works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.
