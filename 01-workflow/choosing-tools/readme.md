# Acquire Your Tools

## Getting on Slack

Likely you've already gotten an email about signing up for our student Slack group - [ga-students.slack.com](ga-students.slack.com). If you haven't already signed up, please take a second to do so now.

Once you've signed up and logged into the Slack app, let's make sure you're in the right channels. Here are some you should definitely be a part of:

* sei-sea-30
* seattle
* sea-frontdesk

> Tip: We'll be communicating on Slack a LOT. It's going to be our main source of communication! Get the desktop and phone apps so you don't miss out!
