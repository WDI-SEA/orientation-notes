# Machine Setup

## Some Installations

Let's do a few installations from the command line. 

### Homebrew (Mac only)

First, for Mac users, we're going to be using an installer called "Homebrew". This will allow us to use the "brew" command for any future installations.

> If you're on Linux, you'll be using the "apt-get" command instead of "brew". You don't have to do anything to set it up. Lucky you!

Mac users, open up your terminal and run the following command: (please copy and paste it!)

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Node

TODO

### Xcode (Mac only)

You may have already been prompted to install this when installing homebrew. If not, go ahead and run it now:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

> Note: This one may take a few moments. It's an ideal time to go grab a refill of water or coffee.

### Python

### PostgreSQL

### MongoDB

## Command Line Shortcuts

Now that we know a little bit about using the terminal, let's create some shortcuts in order to make our lives easier. Many times you will want to open up your current location in your text editor of choice. Let's make shortcuts for VS Code and/or Sublime Text and/or Atom.
