# Workflow Topics

Learning programming will be stressful at times during the course, particularly early on! To take some stress off your plate and give you one less thing to worry about, we want to make sure that your computer and tools are all set up correctly.

This is going to include:

* Tips on how to use your Mac like a pro
* Familiarizing with programs and tools we'll be using during the class
* Installing some stuff now so we don't have to take up class time on it
* Learning how to use your command line
* Getting a little more comfortable with Git and Github

Let's get started!
