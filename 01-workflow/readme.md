# Workflow

Code alongs and labs in class may go by really quickly. It's important to know some simple yet crucial things to speed up your development time! This can include helpful plug-ins for your favorite text editor, learning some command line tricks, and memorizing some keyboard shortcuts.

## Helpful Settings and Plug-ins for Text Editors

#### 1. Auto-Save (setting)

You're beating your head against the wall. You just can't find your error and you have no explanation why the computer is acting the way it is. After someone else takes a look it becomes apparent *you just didn't save the file*!! So frustrating! Say goodbye to this problem for good by enabling your text editor to do you a solid and set the auto-save feature on.

Optional but cool.

## Keyboard Shortcuts - Mac

If you're new to using Macs, one of the first new things you'll see on the keyboard is the "command" key. It looks like this `⌘` and it's the first portion of a great many shortcuts. Each shortcut may do different things depending on what you're using. For example, a shortcut may do one thing in your internet browser and another thing in your terminal. For our purposes we'll focus on shortcuts in your web browser (we'll assume Chrome) and your text editor (we'll assume VS Code or Sublime Text).

Go through the following tables and try out each shortcut for yourself.

**In Chrome**

| Combo | What it does |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `⌘ + T` | Opens a new tab in your browser |
| `⌘ + SHIFT + J` | Opens your devtools console |
| `⌘ + SHIFT + I` | Opens your devtools inspector |


**In Sublime Text**

| Combo | What it does |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `⌘ + D` | Select the next text that matches the highlighted text |
