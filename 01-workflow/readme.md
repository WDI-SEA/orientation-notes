Code alongs and labs in class may go by really quickly. It's important to know some simple yet crucial things to speed up your development time! This can include helpful plug-ins for your favorite text editor, learning some command line tricks, and memorizing some keyboard shortcuts.

Say goodbye to this problem for good by enabling your text editor to do you a solid and set the auto-save feature on.
