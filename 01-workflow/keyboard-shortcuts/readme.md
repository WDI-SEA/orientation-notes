# Keyboard Shortcuts

## Keyboard Shortcuts - Mac

If you're new to using Macs, one of the first new things you'll see on the keyboard is the "command" key. It looks like this `⌘` and it's the first portion of a great many shortcuts. Each shortcut may do different things depending on what you're using. For example, a shortcut may do one thing in your internet browser and another thing in your terminal. For our purposes we'll focus on shortcuts in your web browser (we'll assume Chrome) and your text editor (we'll assume VS Code or Sublime Text).

Go through the following tables and try out each shortcut for yourself.

**In Chrome**

| Combo | What it does |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `⌘ + T` | Opens a new tab in your browser |
| `⌘ + SHIFT + J` | Opens your devtools console |
| `⌘ + SHIFT + I` | Opens your devtools inspector |


**In Sublime Text**

| Combo | What it does |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `⌘ + D` | Select the next text that matches the highlighted text |
