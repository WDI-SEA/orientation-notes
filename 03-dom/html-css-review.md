# HTML and CSS Review

HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. CSS stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets. But you already knew that right?

## HTML

In the pre-work, you should have covered using basic HTML elements. Here's a table for review:

| Element | Tag | Purpose |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Paragraph | `<p>` | Block text |
| Headings | `<h1>` through `<h6>` | Important headers | 
| Anchor | `<a>` | Used to create links |
| Ordered/Unordered List | `<ol>` and `<ul>` | Create a bulleted or numbered list |
| Div and Span | `<div>` and `<span>` | Containers for other elements |
| Semantic Tags | for ex, `<main>` or `<section>` | These are divs, but renamed to be more meaningful |
| Image | `<img>` | Display an image |
| Form | `<form>` | A form |
