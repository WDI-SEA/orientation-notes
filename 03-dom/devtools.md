# Devtools and You

## What are devtools? Why should I use them?

## How can I get to my devtools in the browser?

There are a few different ways to get to the devtools

* Keyboard shortcuts: `⌘ + OPTION + I` (Elements Tab) or `⌘ + OPTION + J` (Console Tab)
* Right click (CTRL + Click) and select "Inspect"
* From Chrome's menu located at the top right, select More Tools -> Developer Tools

## Elements Tab

The elements tab allows you to look at the DOM elements. This allows you to see all the HTML and you can click on any element to see the box model and CSS styles. Take a look at the screenshot below of Google's homepage. Notice that the logo is highlighted both on the screen and in the elements tab. Below that, you can see the CSS styles being applied to the logo (`opacity: 1`) and the location it comes from (`doodles.css`).
