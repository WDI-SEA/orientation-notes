Welcome to General Assembly - and certainly for some of you, welcome to Seattle as well!

## So What's This All About?

We know that the 12-week Software Engineering Immersive can feel like a break-neck pace. This 2-day Orientation and Prep Course serves the purpose of letting you get to know your classmates, instructional team, and support staff at GA Seattle as well as doing some machine setup and learning some JavaScript fundamentals at a little bit slower pace as we ramp up into the course.

### Our Goals

**Your instructors getting to know you and your backstory**

Unlike a traditional college classroom, at GA your instructors are invested in you and your success. We want to know about your experiences and goals. Learning at a traditional college is mostly lecture-style. In contrast, think of learning at GA as an ongoing conversation. Day by day, curriculum will be adjusted to the pace of the class and there will be opportunity near the end of the course to request additional lessons outside the baseline topics covered by all campuses.

**You getting to know us**

Of course it's nice to meet your instructors during orientation, but we think it's important for you to know some other faces on campus too! In addition to your two main instructors, you'll meet your evening TAs, the members of the other SEI instructional team, the class ahead of you that is currently about half-way through, and key GA support staff such as your front desk staff, career coaches, and student experience representative.

**Getting a head start on JavaScript, but at a sane pace**

The purpose of the course is not to act as a cram session - we'll have 12 whole weeks for that, and trust us, we'll all need a nap afterward. Instead we'd like to get a few tedious things out of the way such as machine setup, software installations, and text editor configuration.
