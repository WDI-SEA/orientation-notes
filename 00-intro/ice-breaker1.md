# Ice Breaker 1

Welcome to campus! Let's stand up and play a quick game together.

## How it works

One of your instructors will tape a notecard or a piece of paper to your back. On this paper the name of a famous or influential person is written! Everyone in the class will get a notecard with a different name on it, and you'll be able to see eveyone else's except for your own. Let's use "Oprah Winfrey" as an example. You might have something like this taped to your back:

Your job is now to guess the person on your back by asking yes or no questions to your classmates. Try and ask a different person for each question. Guessing "Oprah Winfrey" might look like this:

1. Q: Am I a fictional character? (A: No)
1. Q: Am I an American? (A: Yes)
1. Q: Am I currently living? (A: Yes)
1. Q: Am I a male? (A: No)
1. Q: Am I famous? (A: Yes)
1. Q: Am I a musician? (A: No)
1. Q: Am I rich? (A: Yes)
1. Q: Do I star in a TV show? (A: Yes)
1. Q: Do I portray a fictional character on TV show? (A: No)
1. Q: Do I play myself on my TV show? (A: Yes)
1. Q: Is my TV show a talk show? (A: Yes)
1. Q: Am I Ellen Degeneres? (A: No)
1. Q: Am I Oprah? (A: YES!)

> Note: We try to pick people we think will be difficult to guess but also identifiable to everyone. We don't always hit the mark and it's possible we picked someone you don't know. If you really have no idea, you can give up after 20 questions! Take this opportunity to learn about a new person - particularly if the person is a scientist or influential in computer science!
