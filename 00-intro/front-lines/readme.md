# Front Lines Pro-Tips

Front lines is here to make sure everything at General Assembly Seattle is running smoothly! This may include (but is totally not limited to!) 

* Keeping supplies stocked - paper towels, coffee, hand santizer, those weird little white mints... and everything in-between!
* Setting up for classes or on-campus events
* Handling any issues that come up with the building (it's an old building - give it some grace!)

## Contact

## Front Lines FAQ

#### What do I need to do for print/fax requests?

Email the file to the front desk email listed above. If the info is sensitive (like if you need to print medical or tax info or something) simply request in the email that the document be kept behind the front desk where it can't be seen by passers by.

#### Can I book a phone room?

Yes, with some restrictions. 

1. You can't have it if it's already booked
1. If it's free, please limit your reservation time to a max of 45 minutes
1. Please reserve it for phone/video calls or interviews, don't just book it randomly to do work you could do elsewhere

Additionally, you should be aware that these rooms are not soundproof. Again, for those in the back, **NOT SOUNDPROOF!!**

#### Is there a lost and found?

Yes! It's at the front desk. Please ask a front lines associate, instructor, or another GA staff member if you need to check the lost and found.

#### What does front lines want me to do?

It all boils down to being a responsible adult and respecting the fact that we are all in a shared space. Did you know that your instructors don't actually have desks? This truly is a shared space for all of us!

That said, here are some tips:

* We have a dishwasher, yay! But if that machine is already running... get the sponge, you know the drill!
* Don't throw away metal forks (how has this happened?!)
* Try to remember to wipe down the whiteboards and tables in the classroom at the end of the day (it's not the biggest deal in the world if we're in a hurry and forget one day, but let's try to be kind!)
* If you borrow something from front lines, it's just good form to return it
* If there's a class going on in the room across from the front desk, please be mindful of that
* Label your belongings like waterbottles and chargers. This makes it much easier to return these items to you if you leave them on campus accidentally!

## Activity: Let's get labelled!

We have a label maker on campus, and because we know belongings will inevitably left on campus now and then, let's make sure that our stuff can make it back to us by putting our names on them.

> Tip: If you get a new waterbottle or something else you want to label later in the class, simply ask front lines to print you a new label!
